    "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eThe talk around AI is a hot topic nowadays. ChatGPT is producing spectacular results every day. YouTube recommendation is better than ever. Self-driving cars are becoming common on the road. It seems that AI is taking over the world. But how does AI work? How does AI learn everything at the level of expertise? How can ChatGPT be an expert in both Science and History and you can’t even study one?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have been working on Artificial Intelligence for quite a while now. So, in this article, I will first explain the workings of AI. Then, I will discuss the life lessons from it. I will also share the tips from my IIT preparations, and we will derive a systematic method to learn any skill. This article is based on my understanding of AI and my impression of books on productivity, like Atomic Habits and Deep Work.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eIntroduction\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlphaZero, an AI-based chess bot, trained itself in twenty-four hours to reach a superhuman level of play in the game. It beat or drew humans and other algorithm-based bots in all the games it played. It didn’t lose even once.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is just one example of artificial intelligence learning things at a breath-stopping speed and getting the grandmaster level of expertise. We see several other examples around us daily, from Google Assistant to self-driving cars. But the question arises: how can machines learn things this fast with such perfection while humans take years? Well, the answer can be as simple as this: they are machines.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAn AI-based chess bot differs from an algorithm-based one because we don’t have to tell it what to do in every situation. It is shown hundreds and thousands of games and learns to play by just watching them. A more straightforward example would be image recognition systems. How does an AI know by looking at a picture that it’s a dog or a cat?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe don’t give them explicit instructions on how to recognize an animal. We show the model millions of \u003cem\u003elabeled\u003c/em\u003e pictures of dogs and cats. By \u003cem\u003elabeled pictures\u003c/em\u003e, I mean this: we show the model a picture of a dog and tell them the answer that it’s a dog. Then, we show another picture of a cat and tell them it’s a cat. We keep doing that a million times and our model will learn to distinguish a cat from a dog. Now, if we show it a picture of an animal it has never seen. In that case, it will still tell you the answer with reasonable accuracy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn a nutshell, we don’t tell them the method to go from question to answer for a given task. We will show them the question and then the answer millions of times, and it automatically develops the connection between question and answer. This task can be as simple as finding the roots of a quadratic equation or as tricky as finding the energy eigenvalues for any arbitrary Hamiltonian.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eHow do Machines Learn?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMachines learn using Machine Learning and Deep learning algorithms. We represent the Deep Learning algorithms by Neural Networks, which are said to be inspired by the neurons in our brain. You can learn more about Deep Learning \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk\u0026amp;list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi\"\u003efrom this video series.\u003c/a\u003e The mathematical details are unimportant for the general audience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*5tcTMuWpJrURY67jXgy4zQ.png\" alt=\"\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeural Network example. (source: Geeksforgeeks)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSo, as I mentioned earlier, the Neural Network is shown millions of examples in the form of question-answer pairs. These examples are a set of numbers called \u003cem\u003evectors\u003c/em\u003e. For instance, in our image recognition system, we can assign the color of a pixel a number in the question. And we give number 1 for the answer dog and number 0 for the answer cat.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow, a Neural Network works by creating a non-linear relation between the question vector and the answer vector using a set of adjustable parameters. The unknown path between the question and answer is found by fine-tuning a set of parameters. Well, that is not easy to understand.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe problem is analogous to the process of making tea. You are given the inputs as sugar, tea leaves, and milk. The answer, or the output, is a perfect tea. Now, you need to find a way, a path from the input to the output. This path can be mapped to the quantities of each item you will take. These quantities are the adjustable parameters. We can tune these parameters to find the answer. (I am oversimplifying it and going away from the essence.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHere is how a Neural Network works: at the beginning, it will assign random values to the adjustable parameters and predict the answer. Now, the value is compared to the actual answer. The network will see how badly it has done. It will check the distance between its prediction and the actual answer, and based on the distance, it will change the adjustable parameters. In our teapot analogy, the chef named Nureal Net will take random measures of sugar and milk and prepare the tea. After preparing the tea, it will taste it. And based on how bad it tastes, the chef will change the value of quantities. It does the same job millions of times. Each time, make predictions, compare with the actual results, and adjust the parameters until the prediction equals the actual result.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis process of showing question-answer example pairs and adjusting the parameters to the optimal values is called training. Once the training is done, our neural net can answer the question it has never seen before. So if you ask our chef to make coffee, it will make a perfect coffee for you.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe can draw real-life conclusions now that we have understood the neural network’s working process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eDon’t be a machine!\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI want to ensure one thing: I am not asking to be a machine. Machines are superior to us, and we can never be like machines. But I want to draw your attention to a straightforward fact: \u003cstrong\u003eNeural Networks are inspired by the neurons in our brain.\u003c/strong\u003e Our brain works essentially the same way as the neural network. And we learn the same way as a neural network learns.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can ask your mother how she learned to make such delicious food. She would tell you the process. The secret is to put the right amount of the ingredients. And how did she learn the right amount? She started with a random guess. But after every meal, she got feedback from her family, like the food was less salty or more salty. And after the feedback, she would adjust the amount of salt. It happened day after day until she learned the right amount of spices.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe point is by learning the method of Neural Networks, we can effectively trick our minds to learn new things. We can develop a similar learning algorithm on our own.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBut then what will the difference between us and the machines? The difference is that the machines are faster than us and can perform more actions simultaneously. But we are already more intelligent than machines. We don’t need to look at a picture of a cat a million times to recognize it as a cat. We don’t need a million iterations to learn something. We can learn it in a few hundred iterations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eBeat The Inertia\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe first lesson from analyzing the process is that starting the training is the most important thing. Most of us think we need to know at least something to learn a skill. Or we need a proper teacher to start learning a skill. So here is the critical point: you need nothing but dedication to begin learning the craft. You don’t need the right time and the right place. Today, with the internet’s and YouTube’s power, you can learn anything from anywhere. So don’t overthink about it; just start, and you will see the pieces falling into place.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe other crucial thing I learned from Machine Learning is in the first few iterations, the errors will be prominent, and the predictions will be horrible. After a hundred iterations, your Neural Network may recognize a picture of a cat as a snake. The same will happen with humans when we start learning a new skill. The results will not show directly after one or two days. We will be horrible at the thing at first. But we should not be demotivated by that. We should stick to the process and keep working on it. As the time progresses, we will get better. Even if we don’t see immediate results, we should keep hustling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe third thing is that the whole process is probabilistic. Our Neural Network can be flawed. It will make the correct prediction 99% of the time, but 1% is not improbable. Even after training over a million examples, it can occasionally give you a wrong prediction. ChatGPT gives the wrong answer sometimes. But it doesn’t mean that the machine is every time wrong. It will provide good results for the next question.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSimilarly, if you are performing below your level in your field, it doesn’t mean you are not good enough. It means you are going through a rough phase and will be fine next time. Remember, Virat Kohli didn’t score a century for nearly three years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eFeedback Is Crucial\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI closely explained the working process of a neural network. At the end of every iteration, it compares its prediction to the actual answer. It sends back the message to adjust the parameters. This process is called \u003cem\u003eBackpropagation.\u003c/em\u003e In simple words, it is a feedback loop.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*hAEalSpM8SaQmEpKJfjsmg.png\" alt=\"\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe feedback loop of learning: Source: Crowdmark\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt can directly be applied to learning a skill in real life. At the end of every day, you will compare what your current status is and what it should be. Based on the difference between these two, you might see what’s wrong with the process, and you fix that. You have to ensure that you are going in the right direction after specified time steps.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen preparing for the IIT entrance exams, I had a plan for the preparation. After every month, I checked that this much portion should have been covered by now. And if that had not been covered, I reviewed what went wrong in the month’s preparation. I could quickly identify the mistakes and ensure I didn’t repeat the same mistakes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe can make these checks more often. We can put these feedback loops every week or even daily. For example, my perfect day would be a day that has an hour of exercise, some studying, some book reading, some writing, etc. I would write that on a paper and put it on my wall. At the end of every day, I check how my day went and how far it was from the ideal day. Based on the distance, I would ask why it was the case. Then, I changed my routine and did the same thing the next day. I will do that repeatedly until my days start going like the ideal day.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe point is making a timetable is not enough. The timetable will never work. You should change your timetable daily to maintain its effectiveness. Every time your plan fails, you should ask questions about why it failed and make changes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eQuality or Quantity\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis question has been repeatedly asked: whether to try and do everything perfectly or do it many times with some improvement every time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen we make a routine (or a timetable), we try to follow it precisely in the first few days. But after a few days, we forget the timetable and return to the lazy and unproductive routine, which happens because we try to make a radical change with a motivation to follow perfectly. This motivation diffuses quickly, and suddenly, the perfect timetable seems like a load.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe can apply a different approach to it, the method of neural networks. When your motivation fades, go on with your regular life. But every evening, compare your day with your timetable and ask why it differs from the timetable. You will get some answers like: because I spent too much time with the gallery after coming from the dinner. So the next day, you try to avoid just that one thing. Practice this for a week. Then, ask the same question and identify and remove another issue. You go on doing it. You do that for a month, and you will notice that your day looks just like your timetable without the extra motivation of perfection.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eHere is the Formula\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat do you need to make your day perfect? What do you need to learn something using the machine learning algorithm? Let’s list the things at the final:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eA clear picture of the end result.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eA set of adjustable variables.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eA timely feedback mechanism.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThousands of repetition, deliberate practices.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo begin to learn something, you need a clear goal. The neural network needs an example answer to compare with at the end of every iteration. You need a clear goal to compare your progress with at the end of a specified time step. You need to be clear about what you want to be to check how far you are from becoming your dream person. So, when starting something new, always be clear about what you want to be. You can either idealize a person or write goals on your wall.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSecondly, you need a tracking or constant feedback system in our system. This feedback should be independent of the system. Our performance often influences our feedback. For example, if you want to lose weight. Your feedback system would be to check your weight every Sunday. But if you are stress-eating and afraid of the results, you don’t go and measure your weight. And this whole system falls out. You need to check your weight no matter your mood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat is where regular mock tests and exams in coaching and universities help. They encourage you to take the tests to get feedback about how you are doing in the journey to pass the exam. These tests are often compulsory and are independent of your mood.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThirdly, you need adjustable variables. That means you need to find out what to change after you get your feedback. For example, after getting the results of your tests, you find out that your Physics marks are good, but your Chemistry sucks. That means that you need to give extra time to Chemistry, and you can reduce your time on Physics.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe fourth point means that you need to repeat this same process thousands of times. Giving just one mock test won’t help. You must take a full-length mock test every week even if you still need to complete the syllabus. You must do it until the day of your exam. That’s what got me to IIT.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg src=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*XHqlLvjjZ6c9cumXYb8K4A.png\" alt=\"\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThanks for the image.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eApplications\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis process has a lot of applications for various age groups and almost everything in life. But primarily, it can be used for the optimization process. Work-life balance is an excellent example. You need to spend more time at work to earn more grades or money. But you should spend more time with your family to maintain your mental health. You can use the same process to determine precisely what proportion of time you should divide to have a happy wife and handsome chances of promotion.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStudents can use this method to achieve their goals and rank well in competitive exams. I used this method while preparing for the IIT entrance exam. I am currently studying in one of the top three IITs (that ranking is subjective, but I rank IITM as third.) So, it’s a trusted and recommended-by-toppers strategy.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eReferences\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e3b1b’s excellent video series on the working of Neural Networks: \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk\u0026amp;list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aircAruvnKk\u0026amp;list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eVeritasium: How to become an expert: \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eW6Eagr9XA\u0026amp;t=708s\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5eW6Eagr9XA\u0026amp;t=708s\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMark Rober: How to learn anything \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vJRopau0g0\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9vJRopau0g0\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBook: Atomic Habits by Jams Clear and his Ted Talk here: \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_nzqnXWvSo\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_nzqnXWvSo\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHuge, if true: AI art \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiJeB2NJy1A\"\u003ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiJeB2NJy1A\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBook: How To Become A Straight-A Student and Deep Work by Cal Newport\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n"

Unit tests basically do the same.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy approach to unit testing has remained more or less the same since I started writing them. But when I started learning go programming language, I came across this really simplistic, elegant and beautiful way to write unit test.

The point of this post is to\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eSimple Unit Tests\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet's say we are writing a function that \u003cem\u003esimplifies\u003c/em\u003e a string, meaning that it removes all the punctuation and trailing white spaces and converts it into lowercase. I would write a small python function to achieve that:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode class=\"language-python\"\u003e\ndef simplify(s: str) -\u0026gt; str:\n    '''remove punctuations and make lowercase for a string'''\n    \n    punctuation = '''!\u0026quot;#$%\u0026amp;\\'()*+,-./:;\u0026lt;=\u0026gt;?@[\\\\]^_`{|}~'''\n    trans_map = s.maketrans({p:\u0026quot;\u0026quot; for p in punctuation})\n    \n    #remove punctuation\n    s = s.translate(trans_map)\n    \n    # remove trailing whitespaces\n    s = s.strip()\n    \n    # lowercase\n    s = s.lower()\n\n    return s\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo test this simple function, I would write a simple unit test using python's \u003ccode\u003epytest\u003c/code\u003e library. You can learn more about the pytest library \u003ca href=\"https://pytest.org/\"\u003ehere\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode class=\"language-python\"\u003eimport pytest\ndef test_simplify():\n\n\tinputs = \u0026quot;Boots the bear!\u0026quot;\n\toutputs = \u0026quot;boots the bear\u0026quot;\n\tfunction_output = simplify(input)\n\t\n\tassert function_output == outputs\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI used to write test like that when I was kid. But that does the job. See I have used \u003ccode\u003einputs\u003c/code\u003e as a variable even though it's singular because \u003ccode\u003einput\u003c/code\u003e in python is a keyword (\u003ccode\u003ein\u003c/code\u003e is also a keyword in python). While we can use \u003ccode\u003einput\u003c/code\u003e as a variable but if then try to use it a keyword, it might cause a problem. Another convention is to use \u003ccode\u003einputs_\u003c/code\u003e with an underscore. But either way is fine.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis works well for one input, but if wan to test for multiple cases, we can do scale it using a dictionary.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode class=\"language-python\"\u003e\ndef test_simplify():\n\n    test_cases = [\n        {\n            \u0026quot;inputs\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;Boots the bear!\u0026quot;,\n            \u0026quot;want\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;boots the bear\u0026quot;,\n        },\n        {\n            \u0026quot;inputs\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;The wonderful bear, Boots \u0026quot;,\n            \u0026quot;want\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;the wonderful bear boots\u0026quot;,\n        },\n        {\n\t\t\t\u0026quot;inputs\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\n\t\t\t\u0026quot;want\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\n\t\t},\n\n\t\t{\n\t\t\t\u0026quot;inputs\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;.......\u0026quot;,\n\t\t\t\u0026quot;want\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\n\t\t},\n    ]\n\n    for test_case in test_cases:\n        got = simplify(test_case[\u0026quot;inputs\u0026quot;])\n        assert got == test_case[\u0026quot;want\u0026quot;], f\u0026quot;{test_case[\u0026quot;want\u0026quot;]=}, {got=} \u0026quot;\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is beautiful, with this we can test can test a few edge cases and determine if our code holds up to them before it crashes in the production level. We can run these test cases using \u003ccode\u003epytest\u003c/code\u003e in our command line:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode class=\"language-bash\"\u003eshyam@laptop: pytest\nplatform linux -- Python 3.13.5, pytest-8.3.4, pluggy-1.5.0\nrootdir: /home/shyam/github/whateverproject\nplugins: anyio-4.7.0\ncollected 4 items                                                                 \n\ntests.py .....

Sometimes we know that the test will fail in certain cases, we expect some error, and if our test is bypassing these errors then that might a bad sign. We want to detect that early. So we write a error prone test just to test it out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode class=\"language-python\"\u003edef test_simplify():\n\n\n    test_cases = [\n        {\n            \u0026quot;args\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;Boots the bear!\u0026quot;,\n            \u0026quot;want\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;boots the bear\u0026quot;,\n            \u0026quot;want_error\u0026quot;: False\n        },\n        {\n            \u0026quot;args\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;The wonderful bear, Boots \u0026quot;,\n            \u0026quot;want\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;the wonderful bear boots\u0026quot;,\n            \u0026quot;want_error\u0026quot;: False\n        },\n        {\n            \u0026quot;args\u0026quot;: 23,\n            \u0026quot;kwargs\u0026quot;: {},\n            \u0026quot;want\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;the wonderful bear, boots\u0026quot;,\n            \u0026quot;want_error\u0026quot;: True\n        },\n    ]\n\n    for test_case in test_cases:\n        if test_case[\u0026quot;want_error\u0026quot;]:\n            flag = False\n            try: \n                got = simplify(test_case[\u0026quot;args\u0026quot;])\n            except:\n                flag = True\n            assert flag , f\u0026quot;Wanted an error but got none\u0026quot;\n            continue\n        got = simplify(test_case[\u0026quot;inputs\u0026quot;])\n        assert got == test_case[\u0026quot;want\u0026quot;], f\u0026quot;{test_case[\u0026quot;want\u0026quot;]=}, {got=} \u0026quot;\n\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow we are talking. There we can see that if we get an integer instead of a string, the programs should fall apart and if it doesn't then something fishy is surely going on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow we are heading towards table driven testing. You can notice that the \u003ccode\u003etest_cases\u003c/code\u003e variable looks like a \u003ccode\u003ejson\u003c/code\u003e file. It can be saved alone as json, and can also be made as a table. That's why we are calling it table driven tests. We can abstract a few thing out of here.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou see that the bottom part of testing logic will basically be the same for all the functions we want to test. So I can write it in a separate function:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode class=\"language-python\"\u003eimport ast\ndef RUN(function: ast.FunctionDef , test_cases: list[dict]):\n\n    for test_case in test_cases:\n\n        if \u0026quot;kwargs\u0026quot; not in test_case.keys(): test_case[\u0026quot;kwargs\u0026quot;]={}\n        if \u0026quot;want_error\u0026quot; not in test_case.keys(): test_case[\u0026quot;want_error\u0026quot;]=False\n\n        if test_case[\u0026quot;want_error\u0026quot;]:\n            flag = False\n            try: \n                got = function(*test_case[\u0026quot;args\u0026quot;], **test_case[\u0026quot;kwargs\u0026quot;])\n            except:\n                flag = True\n            assert flag , f\u0026quot;Wanted an error but got none\u0026quot;\n            return\n\n        got = function(*test_case[\u0026quot;args\u0026quot;], **test_case[\u0026quot;kwargs\u0026quot;])\n        assert got == test_case[\u0026quot;want\u0026quot;], f\u0026quot;{test_case[\u0026quot;want\u0026quot;]=}, {got=} \u0026quot;\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis \u003ccode\u003eRUN\u003c/code\u003e will run test cases for all the functions for a bunch of testing pairs. And the logic even simplifies now:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode class=\"language-python\"\u003edef test_simplify():\n\n\n    test_cases = [\n        {\n            \u0026quot;args\u0026quot;: [\u0026quot;Boots the bear!\u0026quot;],\n            \u0026quot;want\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;boots the bear\u0026quot;,\n            \u0026quot;want_error\u0026quot;: False\n        },\n        {\n            \u0026quot;args\u0026quot;: [\u0026quot;The wonderful bear, Boots \u0026quot;],\n            \u0026quot;want\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;the wonderful bear boots\u0026quot;,\n            \u0026quot;want_error\u0026quot;: False\n        },\n        {\n            \u0026quot;args\u0026quot;: [23],\n            \u0026quot;kwargs\u0026quot;: {},\n            \u0026quot;want\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;the wonderful bear, boots\u0026quot;,\n            \u0026quot;want_error\u0026quot;: True\n        },\n    ]\n\n    RUN(mod.simplify, test_cases)\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow this looks really simple and beautiful.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e==NOTE==: \u003ccode\u003eargs\u003c/code\u003e is not a simple string anymore, it's a list. (Well technically they should the tuple.) You might make that mistake so keep that in your mind.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is not really a well written \u003ccode\u003eRUN\u003c/code\u003e function because it doesn't specify the kind of exception we are looking for it just looks for an error to pass the test. So if the error is because of a different reason, our test will still pass. That could be dangerous as well. So ideally we should include that Exception too in our tables.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode class=\"language-python\"\u003etest_Case = {\n            \u0026quot;args\u0026quot;: [\u0026quot;Boots the bear!\u0026quot;],\n            \u0026quot;want\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;boots the bear\u0026quot;,\n            \u0026quot;want_error\u0026quot;: False\n            \u0026quot;exception\u0026quot;: AttributeError\n        },\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd we should update our \u003ccode\u003eRUN\u003c/code\u003e function appropriately, we will do that shortly. Before that we need to address the lots of if blocks in there.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGolang handles these test cases by making a struct of example cases. We don't have structs in python. The closest thing to a struct in python is a \u003ccode\u003edataclass\u003c/code\u003e. We will define the test \u003ccode\u003edataclass\u003c/code\u003e as the following:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode class=\"language-python\"\u003efrom dataclasses import dataclass, field\nfrom typing import Any, Callable, Type, Tuple\n\n@dataclass\nclass Case:\n    #inputs\n    args: Tuple[Any, ...]\n    want: Any | Tuple[Any] | None = None\n\n    kwargs: dict[str, Any] | None = field(default_factory=dict)\n    exception: Type[Exception] | Tuple[Type[Exception], ...] = Exception\n    want_error: bool = False\n    name: str | None = None\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt first glance, this might look a lot more complicated then our simple list of dictionaries but we aren't doing much here then defining the datatypes of the same variables. There are \u003ccode\u003eargs\u003c/code\u003e as the list (tuple) of \u003ccode\u003eAny\u003c/code\u003e(which means literally any type). The want argument is an \u003ccode\u003eAny\u003c/code\u003e \u003ccode\u003e|\u003c/code\u003e (this pipe means \u003ccode\u003eor\u003c/code\u003e) tuple because there can be multiple outputs, and in Python, they are stored as tuples. (Here we have an edge over golang.) \u003ccode\u003ekwargs\u003c/code\u003e is called keyword arguments. They are like named arguments in a function. The optional type for that was suggest by GPT after a lot of debugging.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe \u003ccode\u003eexception\u003c/code\u003e field is the most interesting one. Since Exception doesn't have a build in type in python, we have used \u003ccode\u003eType\u003c/code\u003e to convert. It can also be a tuple. See the default value I have written is literal Exception. That was my intuition because when we have a particular exception while using the \u003ccode\u003etry-except\u003c/code\u003e block, we use that otherwise we do something akin to:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode class=\"language-python\"\u003etry:\n    f(1,0)\nexcept Exception:\n    print(\u0026quot;Something\u0026quot;)\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow we can simplify the run function:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode class=\"language-python\"\u003edef RUN(function: Callable, test_cases: list[Case]):\n\n    for test_case in test_cases:\n        if test_case.want_error:\n            with pytest.raises(test_case.exception):\n                function(*test_case.args, **test_case.kwargs)\n        else:\n            got = function(*test_case.args, **test_case.kwargs)\n            assert got == test_case.want, f\u0026quot;{test_case.want=}, {got=} \u0026quot;\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThat is very concise and beautiful. We have used \u003ccode\u003epytest.raises\u003c/code\u003e context protocol. This will call the function inside the protocol. If the exception passed here is raised during execution, the test passes, if this exception isn't raised or some other exception is raised then the test fails. If we aren't expecting any error, we will just go and compare the outputs. Now we need to pass in the list of \u003ccode\u003eCase\u003c/code\u003e objects instead of dictionaries, so I have done that in a following way:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode class=\"language-python\"\u003edef test_simplify():\n\n    test_cases = [\n        {\n            \u0026quot;args\u0026quot;: [\u0026quot;Boots the bear!\u0026quot;],\n            \u0026quot;want\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;boots the bear\u0026quot;,\n        },\n        {\n            \u0026quot;args\u0026quot;: [\u0026quot;The wonderful bear, Boots \u0026quot;],\n            \u0026quot;want\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;the wonderful bear boots\u0026quot;,\n        },\n        {\n            \u0026quot;args\u0026quot;: [23],\n            \u0026quot;kwargs\u0026quot;: {},\n            \u0026quot;want\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;the wonderful bear, boots\u0026quot;,\n            \u0026quot;want_error\u0026quot;: True,\n            \u0026quot;exception\u0026quot;: AttributeError\n        },\n    ]\n\n    test_cases = [Case(**things) for things in test_cases]\n    RUN(mod.simplify, test_cases)\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf we want to add a new test case, we just need to add a dictionary in the list. And we can keep appending this until we are satisfied. And there we have it, a beautiful, concise and \u003cem\u003epythonic\u003c/em\u003e way to write table-driven tests.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eLimitations\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI have written this for functions with returning values. I haven't yet tried this approach for executive functions or \u003cem\u003evoid\u003c/em\u003e functions.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThis might be hard to integrate for the cases with dependency like databases, this is more helpful to test the helper functions.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhile this is a beautiful framework for writing tests when we have a good \u003ccode\u003ewanted\u003c/code\u003e and \u003ccode\u003egot\u003c/code\u003e pairs. (remember the Leetcode problems?) This isn't the only way to write test case. You can write them however you want. This is just an interesting approach inspired by golang.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWhen Should We Write Test Cases?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have heard people say that we should write test cases for every function that we write. I don't agree with that. We should try to write test cases for every function but we should avoid some scenes as well.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe shouldn't write test cases where the input depends on something external like a big file or a database. That should be tested separately in a manual or some other way. For example, my work involves reading a large file called \u003ccode\u003e.lst\u003c/code\u003e files and then extracting information. While I can collect a bunch of different files to write cases for them, I should avoid that. We might expose valuable company information while testing. We might have to gather a lot of data just to write the one test case which brings me to the second point.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf setting up a test case is more expensive than the value it provides then we should shy away from it. And that happens when we have a lot of external dependencies. For example, to test a function that does some database stuff, we might need to install a database and set up the while thing. These cases should be broken down into simpler helper functions, and only those helper functions should be tested.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf a helper function is to repeated many times is used widely in very different areas in the codebase, then we should definitely write test cases for it. But if the function is called just once, then we are wasting our time. And also if a function is very simple, e.g. does only lowercase in our example, then there is no point writing a test case in that.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eTesting Automation with GitHub Actions\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNow that we have set up a few test cases, we should connect them with GitHub actions. There are following benefits:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIt runs automatically on every push, and if a test fails, it sends us a nice email.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIt makes collaboration easier by checking on every PR.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eIt informs you if you refactoring breaks anything. So you can go back to previous comments.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can check python testing workflows in GitHub actions marketplace. I use this for all my repositories. Here is a test file.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre\u003e\u003ccode class=\"language-yml\"\u003ename: RAG Testing\n\non:\n  push:\n    branches: [ \u0026quot;main\u0026quot; ]\n  pull_request:\n    branches: [ \u0026quot;main\u0026quot; ]\n\npermissions:\n  contents: read\n\njobs:\n  build:\n\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n\n    steps:\n    - uses: actions/checkout@v4\n    - name: Set up Python 3.13\n      uses: actions/setup-python@v3\n      with:\n        python-version: \u0026quot;3.13\u0026quot;\n    - name: Install dependencies\n      run: |\n        python -m pip install --upgrade pip\n        pip install flake8 pytest\n        pip install -r requirements.txt  \n        if [ -f requirements.txt ]; then pip install -r requirements.txt; fi\n    - name: Lint with flake8\n      run: |\n        # stop the build if there are Python syntax errors or undefined names\n        flake8 . --count --select=E9,F63,F7,F82 --show-source --statistics\n        flake8 . --count --exit-zero --max-complexity=10 --max-line-length=127\n    - name: Test with pytest\n      run: |\n        pytest\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI haven't written this, I have directly copied from GitHub marketplace. but you can copy and paste this too.

This should work just as fine. Make sure you have a \u003ccode\u003erequirements.txt\u003c/code\u003e file.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eConclusion\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWriting good tests has always been an industry standard in the tech community. Most, if not all, the companies in the world implement unit test cases to make software developments standard and smooth. But outside the corporate test cases are rather underrated. I think there are many interesting uses of test cases.\nIf you are a computer science teacher, you an use test cases to grad assignments from your students. You can also put it through PR and use GitHub actions to auto grad the assignments.\nIf you are a researcher, and you are trying different models (for moving the droplet in chemical field for example.) You can write test cases to determine the level of physics your model is reaching.\nIf you are writing blog posts like this, you should also implement test cases to prevent yourself from publishing bullhit online.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnyway I hope you have enjoyed this blog post.

    "content_html": "\u003cp\u003eHow many times have you had a heated discussion with your friend or colleague and felt like they have been brainwashed? How many times have you been left frustrated thinking why the other person is so unaware of social injustice? Why are they being such an \u003cem\u003eandhbhakt\u003c/em\u003e? And how many times have you thought that it might have been you who has been brainwashed?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWhat are belief bubbles?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore we start discussing belief bubbles, I want to talk about \u003cem\u003econformation bias\u003c/em\u003e. It's a known fact that we tend to seek the information which aligns with our existing beliefs and ignore the facts that go directly against them. This is called conformation bias. For example, when we come across something good about the ruling party, we genuinely believe it; however, if something against it pops up, we tend to dismiss it, saying it’s propaganda from the opposition.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe tend to mingle more with people who share our beliefs and distance ourselves from those who don't. And if we find something that directly challenges our preexisting norm, we become uncomfortable. This is called cognitive dissonance (this might not be the correct definition. Psychologists, please spare me.)\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSocial media algorithms amplify the conformation bias. These platforms are designed to maximise the time you spend on them. And in doing so, they detect your beliefs by your interactions, and after that, they will only show content that aligns with your belief system, so that you engage with it more. It filters out the information that might cause cognitive dissonance and mental discomfort when dealing with it. So it is also named \u003cstrong\u003eFilter Bubble\u003c/strong\u003e sometimes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eyour filter bubble is your own personal, unique universe of information that you live in online. And what’s in your filter bubble depends on who you are, and it depends on what you do. But the thing is that you don’t decide what gets in. And more importantly, you don’t actually see what gets edited out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e~ Eli Pariser, Beware online: Filter Bubbles\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter continuous exposure to such content, your beliefs become stronger and stronger. For example, if you believe that the government is bad, then your feed will only show you bad things about the government, and you will be convinced that the government can never do anything wrong, and vice versa. It can take your beliefs from mild interest to extremes in a matter of reels.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe impact is severe on a mass scale. If the whole of a community is addicted to content consumption on social media, then society will become polarised very soon.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eThe Problem with belief bubbles\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOverestimation of the prevalence of our beliefs and losing grip on reality\u003c/strong\u003e is one of the most visible effects on these belief bubbles. Especially when people aren't aware of the algorithm, they will think that everyone \u003cem\u003eactually\u003c/em\u003e thinks in the same way. Which makes them feel like their beliefs are more prominent than they actually are.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn addition, one of the biggest issues of filter bubbles is they are invisible, and people don’t realize that they are seeing something different than everyone else. This leads them to believe that their opinion must be right, because all they see is their side and they assume everyone else is seeing that too.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e~\u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/@10797952?source=post_page---byline--df6c5cbf919f---------------------------------------\"\u003eKristen Allred\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eOnce a person said to me that the government is going to shut down schools and make education online for everyone because in every other school, a teacher is accused of sexual harassment.

Filter bubbles communicated through social media can result in polarisation because the beliefs of people will be taken to the extreme. But the even more dangerous impact is that it can propagate the 'us' vs 'them' formalism. It will widen the gap between 'us' and them which can result in dangerous consequences.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eA narrower viewpoint prevents us from gaining new knowledge\u003c/strong\u003e. Social media is designed to show us only one side of the coin which can never be the whole and true knowledge. The reels from the opposite side make us feel uncomfortable and we tend to ignore and skip them rather than take the effort to analyse and gather knowledge from them.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eHow to navigate belief bubbles without being 'brainwashed'\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eFirst, you should voluntarily expose yourself to the contrary belief\u003c/strong\u003e. If you are an atheist, then you should unfollow your favourite creators and start listening to the arguments from people like William Lane Craig. These arguments are going to make you uncomfortable, but instead of skipping over or laughing it off. You should really put your beliefs to the test. You should defend your conventions and try to come up with counterarguments. I again want to paraphrase Derek Muller, paraphrasing Popper:\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe only way to prove something is to try as hard as you can to disprove it.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMy friend \u003ca href=\"https://vkj-here.blogspot.com\"\u003eVinod Jiani\u003c/a\u003e once told me that to make sure he doesn't fall into fanboy culture, he tries to read criticism of the author he likes the most. At the time, he was reading why Yuvalian’s narrative of history is problematic. I think we all should try to find flaws in our heroes.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eI think that we should try to \u003cstrong\u003econsume knowledge in its rawest form\u003c/strong\u003e. This way, we can eliminate the fight on interpretation and come up with our own strongly backed belief. Which means that instead of consuming content on social media, we should read books, reports, and documentaries, do our own research to gain knowledge. Instead of watching popular God-debunked-with-science videos, we should take university courses on religious philosophy. And read the god-damned scriptures.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWe should participate more in debates and try to gain knowledge through dialogues (which is called \u003cem\u003eThe Socratic Method\u003c/em\u003e). But we shouldn't enter a debate trying to win the argument but trying to learn something from the other person. It's highly unlikely that a debate might change your perspective, but we should observe ourselves if we are able to come up with counterarguments and defend our beliefs. It will show us if they are strongly rooted. And hence we can burst the belief bubble.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMy best advice is don't use social media. Stay away from it. Enjoy your life offline.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eConclusion\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt is said that a life unexamined is a life not worth living. As a professional rest-framer, I often think about how we can understand different frames of reference better. And my personal experience is that the filter bubble from social media makes us lean towards one point of view and hold others. But as an AI enthusiast, I know how these things work and I know that they can be altered to fit my choices. Filter bubbles are dangerous and they have dangerous consequences, but just knowing that they exist is one big caution to make sure that you won't fall for them. And I have tried to achieve that in my post.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eReferences\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8ofWFx525s\"\u003eBeware online \u0026quot;filter bubbles\u0026quot; - Eli Pariser\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://longevitygains.com/belief-bubbles-how-to-avoid-the-worldview-backfire-effect/\"\u003eThe Problem With Social Media Reinforcement Bubbles\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/data-and-beyond/how-filter-bubbles-are-biasing-your-opinions-on-social-media-9469b940154\"\u003eHow Filter Bubbles are biasing your opinions of social media\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://arxiv.org/html/2307.01221\"\u003eStudy on existence of filter bubbles in modern recommendation systems.\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://medium.com/@10797952/the-causes-and-effects-of-filter-bubbles-and-how-to-break-free-df6c5cbf919f\"\u003eThe Causes and Effects of “Filter Bubbles” and how to Break Free￼\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n"
